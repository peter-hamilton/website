Conductor is a prototype framework that supports the creation and evaluation of cross-device applications. The project was completed during my graduate work at the University of Toronto. The work resulted in a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/2556288.2557170){:target="_blank"} published in the proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (2014).

### Highlights

- Designed and implemented a set of interactions for passing digital resources between applications running on multiple devices.
- Created an ecosystem of Android applications (e.g., email, maps, notepad, etc.) that demonstrated the use cases that Conductor's cross-device interactions made possible.
- Conducted a user study where participants performed a ~2 hour sense-making task using 10 tablets running Conductor applications.
