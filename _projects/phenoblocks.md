PhenoBlocks is a project I worked on with [Mike Glueck](http://www.mikeglueck.com/){:target="_blank"} during my graduate work at the University of Toronto. The work resulted in a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467733){:target="_blank"} published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (2015).

### Highlights

- PhenoBlocks is powered by a backend service that compares phenotypes (i.e., observable characteristics) from the [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/) against a large dataset of patients with hereditary disorders.
- PhenoBlocks provides a web interface that provides an interface for inputting phenotypes and visualizes how they compare to patients in the dataset.
