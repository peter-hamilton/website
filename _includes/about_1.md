I am a former academic, turned software engineer, who thrives when tackling challenging problems and learning new technologies. I've demonstrated effectiveness in a broad range of software domains, including back-end web development, building hardware SDKs, and creating UX prototypes. In my previous life, my research explored ways of improving the developer experience of creating the cross-device interactions envisioned by Ubiquitous Computing.
